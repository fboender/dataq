v0.3 blocking:

Non-blocking:
[ ] Support for non-decimal host addresses.
[ ] Request info should be passed around as an object or possibly a dict instead of seperate host, username, etc information.
[ ] Stress-testing
[ ] Static queues (POPing doesn't actually pop, just returns the last value).
    Maybe make this into a new Request type
[ ] Inverse daemon option. (default = daemon, non-daemon is commandline option)
[ ] syslog logging.
[ ] init.d scripts.
