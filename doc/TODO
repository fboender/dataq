v0.2 blocking:

Non-blocking:
[ ] Verbose is handled as global, should be config that is global.
[ ] Verbose doesn't work as a configuration-file option.
[ ] Request info should be passed around as an object or possibly a dict instead of seperate host, username, etc information.
[ ] Stress-testing
[ ] Static queues (POPing doesn't actually pop, just returns the last value).
    Maybe make this into a new Request type
[ ] Inverse daemon option. (default = daemon, non-daemon is commandline option)
[ ] Report server starting problems on stdout.
[ ] syslog logging.
[ ] init.d scripts.
[ ] Handle XML parsing errors.
